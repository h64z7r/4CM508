They serve a diverse clientele, including professional artists, hobbyists, and art schools. The store employs 5 sales associates who assist customers in finding the right products and manage the day-to-day operations of the store.
Currently, CraftMasters Art Supplies captures all their sales transactions, inventory levels, and customer details using a paper-based system.

Recognizing these issues, CraftMasters Art Supplies has decided to digitize their entire operation. They aim to implement a modern, integrated digital solution that will allow them to streamline inventory management, enhance customer relationship management (CRM), and optimize sales processes.
You have been hired as an external consultant to help CraftMasters Art Supplies transition from their paper-based system to a digital platform.
